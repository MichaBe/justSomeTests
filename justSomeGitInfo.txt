git merge:

//change to the branch, you want to merge into:
git checkout master

//merge the issue-branch into the current branch:
git merge issue
//useful options: -m "message for merge"

git rebase:
reapply commits on top of another base tip
if "issue" is the current branch, and it should 
be on top of "master", than the following command 
will do that:
git rebase master


          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master

will change to

                  A'--B'--C' topic
                 /
    D---E---F---G master
